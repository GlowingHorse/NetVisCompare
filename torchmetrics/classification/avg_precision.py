class AveragePrecision(Metric):
    """Computes the average precision score, which summarises the precision recall curve into one number. Works for
    both binary and multiclass problems. In the case of multiclass, the values will be calculated based on a one-
    vs-the-rest approach.

    Forward accepts

    - ``preds`` (float tensor): ``(N, ...)`` (binary) or ``(N, C, ...)`` (multiclass) tensor
      with probabilities, where C is the number of classes.

    - ``target`` (long tensor): ``(N, ...)`` with integer labels

    Args:
        num_classes: integer with number of classes. Not nessesary to provide
            for binary problems.
        pos_label: integer determining the positive class. Default is ``None``
            which for binary problem is translated to 1. For multiclass problems
            this argument should not be set as we iteratively change it in the
            range ``[0, num_classes-1]``
        average:
            defines the reduction that is applied in the case of multiclass and multilabel input.
            Should be one of the following:

            - ``'macro'`` [default]: Calculate the metric for each class separately, and average the
              metrics across classes (with equal weights for each class).
            - ``'micro'``: Calculate the metric globally, across all samples and classes. Cannot be
              used with multiclass input.
            - ``'weighted'``: Calculate the metric for each class separately, and average the
              metrics across classes, weighting each class by its support.
            - ``'none'`` or ``None``: Calculate the metric for each class separately, and return
              the metric for every class.

        kwargs: Additional keyword arguments, see :ref:`Metric kwargs` for more info.

    Example (binary case):
        >>> from torchmetrics import AveragePrecision
        >>> pred = torch.tensor([0, 0.1, 0.8, 0.4])
        >>> target = torch.tensor([0, 1, 1, 1])
        >>> average_precision = AveragePrecision(pos_label=1)
        >>> average_precision(pred, target)
        tensor(1.)

    Example (multiclass case):
        >>> pred = torch.tensor([[0.75, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05],
        ...                      [0.05, 0.75, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05],
        ...                      [0.05, 0.05, 0.75, 0.05, 0.05],
        ...                      [0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.75, 0.05]])
        >>> target = torch.tensor([0, 1, 3, 2])
        >>> average_precision = AveragePrecision(num_classes=5, average=None)
        >>> average_precision(pred, target)
